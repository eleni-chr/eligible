# eligible
The function decides whether a university applicant is eligible for admission based on GRE scores. The function takes two positive scalars called v and q as input. They represent the percentiles of the verbal and quantitative portions of the GRE respectively. The applicant is eligible if the average percentile is at least 92% and both of the individual percentiles are over 88%. The function returns the logical true or false.
